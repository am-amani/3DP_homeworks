# 3D Data Processing Course Repository

This repository is created for the 3D Data Processing course at the University of Padova. The aim of this project is to learn about the concepts covered in the course and apply them to various homework assignments. The repository will contain all the completed assignments.

## Project Description

The 3D Data Processing Course Repository is a collection of homework assignments for the 3D Data Processing course at the University of Padova. The assignments will cover topics such as point cloud processing, mesh processing, and 3D data visualization. The code will be written in Python and C++ and will utilize various libraries such as OpenCV, and tools.
